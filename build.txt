Lecture 1: IO
-------------

Prelectures: 1, 2, (not 3), 4, 5, optional: 7b
1. Multiply R1 x R2 -> R3
2. Take a character from the keyboard and send it to the display,
   without using traps / IN / OUT / GETC / PUTC

Lecture 2: Repeated Code TRAP and Subroutine
--------------------------------------------

Prelectures: 6, 7a
1. Configure LC-3 so that TRAP x10 multiplies R1 * R2 and stores the result
   in R0. [Bonus: ensure the loop runs no more than 16 times]
2. Rewrite the multiplication TRAP as a subroutine
3. Write a subroutine to compute the factorial of R1 and puts the result in R0

Lecture 3: Stack
----------------

Prelectures: 8, 9a-b
1. Write PUSH and POP on the stack using R6 as a stack pointer
2. Balanced Parentheses

Lecture 4: Stack Usage
----------------------

Prelectures: 9c
1. A train enters a track in some order given by a string from R1
   and the desired output order is in R2. In between the input and output
   is a spur that serves as a stack. Output the sequence of moves
   the rail cars should follow, where U is push, P is pop, and O is over
   (basically a push and a pop). For example, if the inbound order is ABC,
   and the output order is BAC, then the proper order is UOPO, which pushes
   train A, sends train B over, pops train A, and sends train C over.
2. Write STACKADD and STACKMUL to take the top two values from the stack,
   add and multiply them respectively, and push the result back on the stack.
